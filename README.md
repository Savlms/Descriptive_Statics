The Statistics class provides various statistical calculations for a given set of values. Here's a brief explanation of the key functions:

Measures of Central Tendency:

mean(values): Calculates the mean (average) of the given values.
median(values): Calculates the median (middle value) of the given values.
mode(values): Determines the mode (most frequently occurring value) of the given values.
Measures of Dispersion:

range(values): Computes the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) of the given values.
variance(values): Calculates the variance of the given values.
standardDeviation(values): Computes the standard deviation of the given values.
absoluteDeviation(values): Calculates the mean absolute deviation of the given values.
quartileDeviation(values): Computes the quartile deviation of the given values.
